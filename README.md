# MDT
Code used for the analysis of Multi-physics ensemble modeling, observed discharge Data, and Budyko Theory (MDT) data.
This project visualizes and compares annual mean precipitation (P) and evapotranspiration (ET) estimates from various sources over the period 2000–2018. The figure includes:

Multiple datasets grouped by type (e.g., remote sensing, numerical models).

MDT values with ± standard deviation shaded areas.

Labeled horizontal lines representing the mean value over specific time periods.
